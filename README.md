# Template for Vite + Typescript + React + Tailwind project!

This repo is so I don't have to keep running the same shell commands over and over again and deleting the same files over and over again

## Setup

Ensure you have npm ^11.0.0

```bash
  git clone "https://github.com/rmedcraft/WebTemplate"
```

`cd` into the cloned directory

Install all of the necessary packages
```bash
    npm i
```

Remove the github repo & replace it with a new repo
```bash
    git remote remove origin
    git remote add origin <link to your repo>
```
